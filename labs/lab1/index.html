  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Mofadesewa. Everyone calls me Sewa. I am a Senior majoring in Applied Analytics with Computer Science and Psychology minors. My favorite things to do are binge watch series on Netflix (read The Blacklist, Shameless, Grey's Anatomy, Criminal minds e.t.c.), read novels and buy too many skincare products.</p>
